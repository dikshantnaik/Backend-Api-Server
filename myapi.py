# Python code to demonstrate naive method
# to compute factorial
n = 5
fact = 1

for i in range(1,n+1):
	fact = fact * i

print (fact)

Suppose We have to find factorial of 5 this will be inputed by user ..
So we will declare n = 5;
Now we will use fact variable to store the Answer which is factorial of n;
we will also Inzialize i = 1 as an loop counter
now we will loop step 5.1 and 5.2  till i is equal to n;
